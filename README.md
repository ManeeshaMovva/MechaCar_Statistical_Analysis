## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![summary statistics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74915619/122652289-09d99800-d10c-11eb-9477-b2e06cf83518.PNG)

Vehicle weight, AWD and spoiler angle are variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values in the dataset. 

Seeing as the slopes of the variables are not zero, the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero.

The R squared value for this linear model is 71% which means we can predict MPG of MechaCar prototypes only 71% of the time. Although 71% is a high percentage, I don't believe it's high enough for us to make accurate predictions.
